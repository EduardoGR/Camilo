`** 🙌 New in 1.2 🙌 **` Now Camilo replaces symbol style overrides pointing to a external library with another set of styles from another library. For example, it replaces layer style override "primaryColor" from Brand A Library with "primaryColor" from Brand B Library. Works with text and layer styles.

## How it works?

It replaces symbol style overrides by name

* if the style doesn't exist, nothing happens
* if it does exist, it's overwritten

It replaces styles by name

* if the style doesn't exist, nothing happens
* if it does exist, it's overwritten

It replaces symbols by name

* if the symbol doesn't exist, nothing happens
* if it does exist, it's overwritten
