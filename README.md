## Overview
Here's a Sketch plugin to sync shared text and layer styles from a Sketch Library into the current document.

### How do I use it?
* Run `Apply theme` to replace shared text, shared layer styles and symbols from a Sketch library with the current document

### How does it match styles?
By name
* if the style doesn't exist, nothing happens
* if it does exist, it's overwritten

### Does sync work both ways?
No, sync is only one-way (from Library to document).

## Usage
* press `Control + Command + Shift + J` to choose the theme library you want to sync with, or use the `Plugins` menu
